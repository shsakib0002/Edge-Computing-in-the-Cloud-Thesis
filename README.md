 This study investigates the transformational impact of using edge computing in
 the cloud, specifically focusing on improving the performance of latency-sensitive
 applications via Amazon Web Services (AWS), with a primary emphasis on AWS
 wavelength. The study addresses the growing challenges of managing edge resources,
 ensuring data consistency and security, and seamlessly integrating with cloud services.
 Our proposed approach includes a comprehensive framework for deploying and man
aging AWS resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block
 Store volumes, and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) subnets within wavelength zones,
 which are distinctive zones within carrier locations where wavelength infrastructure is
 deployed. A middleware layer orchestrates and synchronizes data processing and com
munication between the edge and the cloud, utilizing AWS services such as Lambda,
 AmazonElastic File System (EFS), and Aurora DB within the associated AWS region.
 To assess the efficacy of our approach, we present a benchmark tool that measures
 latency, throughput, and cost across various wavelength zones worldwide. Extensive
 testing compares our approach to cloud-only and edge-only strategies, demonstrat
ing significant reductions in latency, increased throughput, and cost efficiency while
 maintaining data security and consistency. In Bangladesh, specific recommendations
 are presented to improve edge applicationsâ€™ latency and user experience. Selecting the
 nearest AWS region and wavelength zone, optimizing network settings, and fostering
 collaboration with local Internet service providers (ISPs) and game developers are all
 suggestions. This collaborative effort aims to integrate AWS Wavelength, providing
 faster and more reliable connectivity and content delivery to end users.
