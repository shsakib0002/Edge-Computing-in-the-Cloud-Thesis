Edge Computing in the Cloud: Improving Latency-Sensitive Applications with AWS
Introduction
This repository contains research on leveraging edge computing within Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance the performance of latency-sensitive applications. The study focuses on AWS Wavelength and its impact on cloud infrastructure.

Research Overview
The research investigates:

Comprehensive Framework: Deployment and management of AWS resources (Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, and VPC) within Wavelength Zones.
Middleware Layer: Orchestration and synchronization of data processing and communication using AWS Lambda, Amazon EFS, and Aurora DB.
Benchmarking and Results
To evaluate our approach, a benchmark tool was developed to measure:

Latency
Throughput
Cost
Key Findings
Significant Reductions in Latency
Increased Throughput
Enhanced Cost Efficiency
Maintained Data Security and Consistency
Recommendations for Bangladesh
To optimize edge application performance in Bangladesh, we suggest:

Selection of AWS Regions and Wavelength Zones: Choose the nearest options to reduce latency.
Optimization of Network Settings: Tailor configurations for improved performance.
Collaboration with Local ISPs and Developers: Work with local providers to integrate AWS Wavelength for better connectivity and content delivery.
Conclusion
Implementing the strategies outlined can significantly enhance cloud service performance, particularly in regions with unique connectivity challenges like Bangladesh.
